# GitBook: kogakure.de

**Work in progress**.

I plan to produce a book out of my website [kogakure.de](https://kogakure.de)
as an additional way to read the content.

This way it’s to read it as webbook, PDF, epub, mobi and it’s possible to
translate it easy into different languages later. The first edition will contain
the German version, which is also provided on the corresponding website.

## Todo

- [x] Create repository and basic files
- [ ] Set up GitBook configuration
- [ ] Decide on structure of book
- [ ] Create build tasks for releasing PDF, epub and mobi
- [ ] Write book
