**Work in progress**.

I plan to produce a [GitBook][gitbook] book out of my website [kogakure.de][kogakure]
as an additional way to read the content. The book will be served [here][project].

This way itâ€™s possible to read it as a webbook, PDF, epub and mobi and it can
be translated into different languages later. The first edition will contain
the German version, which is also provided on the corresponding website.
